## Description 

Here is a link to the deployed application on Github:

Another homework assignment but since I had finished it early that night I decided to mess around with the CSS a bit; I ended up going for a Vaporwave-esque theme. Relatively plain structure wise but one of my favorite themes that I did in class, and helped me figure how to use one of my all-time fave CSS effects.
