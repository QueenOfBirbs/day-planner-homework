# day-planner-homework

///ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA///
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


///WHAT I DID///
i was able to get the layout correct and make the input boxes work. i think i got the local storage bit to work just not the displaying part.
i also couldn't figure out the time change thing unfortunately. i'm happy with the design and the final looks of it so i intend to make it work properly
when i work with my tutor soon.
